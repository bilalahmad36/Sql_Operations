# Sqlite_CRUD_Operations
Here are the simplest and beginner friendly CRUD commands

Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of basic database operations using SQLite3 in Python.
The goal is to understand how to create a database, define tables, and perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Features

Create tables for movies, actors, genres, and theaters

Insert sample data into tables

Update specific columns such as descriptions and attributes

Delete records from tables

Query and fetch data using Python and SQLite3

Technologies Used

SQLite3

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3 installed on your system

SQLite3 (comes pre-installed with Python)

How It Works

The database is created locally (e.g., Tutorial.db).

Tables are created with primary keys and constraints.

CRUD operations are demonstrated through Python commands:

Insert: Adding new rows

Read: Fetching and displaying data

Update: Modifying existing entries

Delete: Removing entries

Purpose

This project was created as a hands-on exercise to build a foundation in database management.
It provides a simple, clear starting point for beginners who want to learn how to interact with databases programmatically.
